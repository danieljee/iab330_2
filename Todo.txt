1. fix adding item quantity

2. Make sure ObservableCollection is notified when children are deleted

3. Clicking individual box in manage boxes page. Each box instance will not load the room info






Bugs Found:
1. Editing an item: Can't change quantity without changing either room type or name as well.
2. When editing item, items are updated after page is refreshed (i.e. you go back)
4. When editing a room type, changing the name will show the "editted" label however, label still displays after going back
4. When editing a box, changing the name will show the "editted" label however, label still displays after going back (Can fix by using a toast message perhaps?)
5. No validation to check if box already exists (i.e. has same name AND same room)
6. Add button on edit box page does not work (remove button?)
7. Editing box details only update when page updates	
8. When deleting an item on search page, the item only disappears after refreshing screen.
